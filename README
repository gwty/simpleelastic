Simple Contacts application using ElasticSearch - Gowtham Ashok

This project uses express.js, elasticsearch.js and mocha.

To run, execute `npm install` and then `npm start`.
To run tests `npm test`

To change elasticsearch port number, go to elasticsearch.js in this directory.



Note: Run the tests after running npm start. I had trouble trying to ensure index creation/deletion was done before the tests start to get executed.

Functions:

Get contacts:
GET /contact?pageSize={}&page={}&query={} and GET /contact/{name} is written and tested

Add contact:
POST /contact has been tested but has been commented out in code

Update contact:
PUT /contact/{name} updates existing contact. Has been implemented but need to test it thoroughly

Delete contact:
DELETE /contact/{name} deletes a contact. It has been implemented but needs to be tested thoroughly


**Error checking (invalid phone_number, contact) is checked in the server side, but can be implemented in the elasticsearch methods if needed.

Difficulties:
Working with promises and elasticsearch

Future Improvements:

Implement promises correctly
Make a docker container for this app
Test with Postman, the REST APIs
Format code and follow best practices for code design
